# Composing With Process RSS

An (stale) RSS feed for Mark Fell's+Joe Gilmore's MACBA production [*Composing With Process. Perspectives on Generative Music*](https://rwm.macba.cat/en/taxonomy_serie_podcast/composing-with-process/) which was published on Radio Web MACBA 2010-2013.

I didn't do any of this, but I am just compiling an RSS for my own re(re(re))listening purposes as a podcast.

## Episodes

2. Systems
3. Determinacy and Indeterminacy

In addition to the main piece, each episode has a PDF transcript andmany an exclusive. I recommend downloading everything using the provided Python program `download.py` or manually in the case this valuable thing goes into bit heaven, and printing the transcripts for study.
